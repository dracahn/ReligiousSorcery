	"description": "Allows the player to craft `sacrificial blood` or `soul essense` from religious items at a rate of 10 religious item to 1 sacrificial blood or 5 soul essense.\nFeat is available after unlocking basic sorcery.  Find it in the Sorcery section.  Costs 1 point.\n\nReason: I think it's reasonable that 10 NPC kills equate to a single sacrifice at the alter.  But dragging thralls takes so long, so I'm skipping that bothersome mess.  It's not too tough to do, just a chore.  So I'm eliminating the chore.\n\nI don't plan on making any other versions with different amounts required to craft.  If you want something like that, ask another mod author.  I'll give them permission make a fork, change the values and re-post, so long as they add me as a contributor on the mod.",
